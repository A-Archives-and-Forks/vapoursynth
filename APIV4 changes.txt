API changes V3->V4

Header files:
All header files have had 4 appended to their name. The V4 files are called:
VapourSynth4.h
VSHelper4.h
VSScript4.h

Core creation:
createCore() now takes a set of flags instead of a thread number since it can be set directly after
construction with setThreadCount() anyway. The flags control the few options that have to be set at
creation time and can't be changed at a later time.

Plugin and function registration:
There's a completely new entry point that takes

Function registrations now take an additional argument for the return type that follows the same
format as the input arguments. If a function has an unknown or simple unpredictable return type
it can be set to "any". Note that V3 functions will have the "any" return type.
Since the audio types anode and a frame were introduced the video counterparts were renamed to
vnode and vframe instead of clip and frame.

Property manipulation:
Audio node and audio frame types were added and the types are now declared as normal enum constants
and not obscure charaters. The best way to think about audio and video nodes are that they're two
separate types that happen to share functions to manipulate them. As a result of this reasoning a
single key in a VSMap can only hold audio or video nodes but not a mix of both. The same applies to
frames (but they're rarely used as arguments).
The data type now has a hint for whether the data should be treated as utf8 or binary which can be
useful for filters that print values. Data set by V3 filters will always be reported as unknown.
Two new convenience functions were added. propGetSaturatedInt and propGetSaturatedFloat which are
equivalent to int64ToIntS(propGetInt) and the same operation for float.

Filter changes:
createFilter has been replaced by createVideoFilter. The init callback has been deprecated and instead
an array of VSVideoInfo is passed directly to createVideoFilter.
The getFrame callback has also been changed in two important ways, the void **instanceData pointer
has been changed to void * to remove the pointless additional indirection. The void **frameData
pointer now points to a scratch space of size void *[4] instead of only being a single pointer.
This can be used to not have to allocate and free memory on every frame processed. See the Splice
filter for an example of this.

Audio filter support:
Audio filters are created with createAudioFilter and work very similarly to video filters. Note that
all audio frames have a fixed size (VS_AUDIO_FRAME_SAMPLES) except for the last one in a clip that may
be shorter if necessary. This needs to be kept in mind when writing filters that append two clips.

Message handlers:
Message handlers are now registered per core and not globally to improve core and environment isolation.
Note that there's no longer a default handler that prints messages to stderr if no handler is installed
so direct users of the core/vsscript need to install one to still get messages printed.
There's also a new mtInformation level that's self-explanatory.

VSHelper:
The header now has all functions placed in the vsh namespace (C++) or prefixes them with vsh (C) in
order to not clutter things up as much. Several functions were also renamed for clarity.
Renamed functions:
all functions with a vs_ prefix had it removed (see C/C++ mode differences above)
vs_aligned_malloc => vsh_aligned_malloc
vs_aligned_free => vsh_aligned_free
VS_ALIGNED_MALLOC => VSH_ALIGNED_MALLOC
VS_ALIGNED_FREE => VSH_ALIGNED_FREE
vs_normalizeRational => reduceRational

VSScript:
