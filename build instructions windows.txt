Default install paths are assumed in all projects and scripts, be prepared to adjust many things if you changed them

Needs Visual Studio 2017 and vsnasm (https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/VSNASM)
Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 is also (unfortunately) required to compile the python module
It also needs both 32 and 64 bit Python 3.6 series with recent cython, sphinx and sphinx-intl installed
Inno setup is needed to create the installer (default installation path assumed)
7-zip is needed to compress the portable version (default installation path assumed)

Clone VapourSynth
Clone zimg v2.6 branch into the VapourSynth dir (https://github.com/sekrit-twc/zimg)
Clone avs+ mt branch into the VapourSynth dir (https://github.com/AviSynth/AviSynthPlus)
Compile 32 and 64 bit release using the VapourSynth solution
Run cython_build.bat to compile the Python modules

In order to build the installer you need to download
and place isxdl.dll in "installer\scripts\isxdl".
It can be downloaded from:
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20868/NET-Framework-Installer-for-InnoSetup

There are also a few plugins that aren't included
which are easier to simply retrieve from an existing
VapourSynth installation.

Note that the Avisynth side of AVFS won't work properly in debug builds (memory allocation and exceptions across module boundaries trolololol)
Likewise AviSource can only be compiled as a release build (or debug versions of functions that aren't present are referenced)
